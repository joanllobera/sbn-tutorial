a demo to use simple behavior networks




NOTE: in timepath4unity, 
TPAction and TPPerception, which are part of the package, are already existing in the tutorial.
These files are where the action and perception methods are defined, and there are custom definitions for the demo.

Therefore, in the import process they are renamed as
TPACtion 1.cs
TPPerception 1.cs
the simplest is to delete the, and keep the previous files,
 since the tutorial version contains custom method definitions apropriate ofr hte demo.
TODO: THIS IS CORRECTED; RIGHT? RECHECK
